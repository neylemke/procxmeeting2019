<p class="noindent">The Brazilian Association of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (AB3C) is a scientific society funded in July 12th 2004. Since
its creation, AB3C has been responsible for the annual conference entitled ”X-Meeting” which is the main Bioinformatics and
Computation Biology event in Brazil. This year its 13th edition occurred in Campos do Jordão from October 30<sup class="textsuperscript"><span

<p class="indent">   Bioinformatics is now a strategic area for Brazil and all Latin America and, therefore, it is also strategic to the development of
Science, Technology and Economy. The X-Meeting is a Brazilian event with international reach which has an average of 200
participants. The Conference is an opportunity for students, researchers and companies to interact and difuse knowledge. The AB3C
has been a pioneer society in the field of Bioinformatics in Brazil and we have a history of ten past very productive
meetings.
